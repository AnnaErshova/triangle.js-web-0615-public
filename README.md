# Triangle JS Edition
## Getting Started

Run `npm install`

## Tests

Run `grunt watch` then edit your files. Grunt will watch for changes. Grunt
will only run tests that start with `it`. When you finish passing a test,
remove the `x` from `xit` to convert it to a runnable test.

## Background

The program should raise an error if the triangle cannot exist.

Tests are provided, delete one `skip` at a time.

The sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle always exceeds the length of the third side, a principle known as the _triangle inequality_.
